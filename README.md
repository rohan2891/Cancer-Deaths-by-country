# Cancer-Deaths-by-country
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview 

This projects analyzes global cancer related deaths by Country using SQL , Python , PowerBI. 
The dataset includes the mortality rates across different regions , helping to identify 
trends , patterns.

ðŸ“Š Objectives

âœ” Identify countries with the highest cancer mortality rates.
âœ” Analyze trends in cancer deaths from 1990 to 2016.
âœ” Find correlations between smoking rates and healthcare access.
âœ” Visualize insights using Power BI


ðŸ“‚ Dataset : Cancer Deaths by Country and Type (1990-2016)






Time Range : 1990-2016

Format: Excel/CSV





ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Processing (Python)

 import pandas as pd 
 
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
 
 import seaborn as sns
 

#Loading of the data for cleaning



 df = pd.read_csv('data/CancerDeaths.csv')





#Checking for any missing values in data



print(df.isnull().sum())

#Filling missing values with 0

 df.fillna(0, inplace = True)

#Checking data after cleaning



df.head(20)
